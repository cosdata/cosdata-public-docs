Cosdata provides advanced search relevance capabilities to ensure your users find exactly what they're looking for.

## Hybrid Search

Enhance search precision and recall with Cosdata's hybrid search, leveraging the power of combined dense, sparse, and full-text (BM25) searches to deliver highly relevant, context-rich results for complex queries.

### How It Works

Hybrid search combines multiple search techniques:

1. **Dense Vector Search**: Uses embeddings to capture semantic meaning
2. **Sparse Vector Search**: Captures keyword importance similar to traditional search
3. **Full-Text Search (BM25)**: Provides fast, scalable keyword and phrase queries with industry-leading performance
4. **Combined Scoring**: Intelligently merges results for optimal relevance and ranking

### Benefits

- Enhanced contextual understanding
- Superior relevance for both semantic and keyword queries
- Lower latency and higher throughput than traditional search engines
- Flexible scoring for a wide range of use cases
